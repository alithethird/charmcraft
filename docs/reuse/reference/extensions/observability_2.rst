After integration, you will be able to observe your workload
using Grafana dashboards.

In addition to that you can also trace your workload code
using `Tempo <https://charmhub.io/topics/charmed-tempo-ha>`__.

To learn about how to deploy Tempo you can read the
documentation `here <https://charmhub.io/topics/charmed-tempo-ha>`__.

OpenTelemetry will automatically read the environment variables
and configure the OpenTelemetry SDK to use them.
See the `OpenTelemetry documentation
<https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
for further information about tracing.
